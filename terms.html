<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="muted">Version: 22 Sep 2025</p>

<h2>1) About Ironwell</h2>
<p>Ironwell (“the App”) is a fitness logging and educational tool developed and published by an individual developer. These Terms govern your use of the App.</p>

<h2>2) No Medical Advice</h2>
<p>The App provides general fitness logging and educational content only. It is not a medical device and does not provide diagnosis, treatment, or personalized medical advice. Consult a qualified healthcare professional before starting any exercise or nutrition program, especially if you have a medical condition, are pregnant, or take medications.</p>

<h2>3) Assumption of Risk</h2>
<p>Exercise carries inherent risks, including injury or death. You understand and voluntarily assume all risks arising from your use of the App. Use proper form and appropriate loads; stop if you feel pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath.</p>

<h2>4) Eligibility & Accounts</h2>
<p>You must be at least the minimum legal age in your region (generally 16+). You agree to provide accurate information and maintain the security of your account. You are responsible for all activity under your account.</p>

<h2>5) Subscriptions & Billing</h2>
<p>Some features may require a paid subscription. Subscriptions (if offered) renew automatically unless canceled before renewal in your platform account settings.</p>
<p><b>How to cancel:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>iOS: App Store → Account → Subscriptions</li>
  <li>Android: Google Play → Payments & subscriptions → Subscriptions</li>
</ul>
<p>Cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing period. Any refunds are handled according to the rules of the platform through which you purchased.</p>

<h2>6) Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>The App and its content are licensed, not sold. All rights are reserved by the developer and licensors. You receive a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes. You may not copy, distribute, modify, or reverse engineer the App.</p>

<h2>7) User Content</h2>
<p>You retain rights to data you input (e.g., workouts, sets, reps, weights). You grant us a limited license to process such data to operate, secure, and improve the App.</p>

<h2>8) Prohibited Uses</h2>
<p>You agree not to misuse the App, including attempting to access systems without authorization, interfering with operation, scraping, or using the App in violation of applicable laws.</p>

<h2>9) Disclaimers</h2>
<p>THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

<h2>10) Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE APP IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain disclaimers or limitations. In such cases, the above applies only to the maximum extent permitted by law and does not limit liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct where prohibited.</p>

<h2>11) Termination</h2>
<p>You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms or misuse. Upon termination, your license to use the App ends.</p>

<h2>12) Changes to the App or Terms</h2>
<p>We may update the App and these Terms. If material changes are made, we will post the new version and update the date above. Your continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

<h2>13) Governing Law & Venue</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <b>[Your State/Country]</b>, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in <b>[Your County/State]</b> for any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App.</p>

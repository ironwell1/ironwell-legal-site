<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="muted">Version: 20 Sep 2025</p>

<h2>1) No Medical Advice</h2>
<p>Ironwell provides general fitness logging and educational content only. It is not a medical device and does not provide diagnosis, treatment, or personalized medical advice. Consult a qualified healthcare professional before starting any exercise or nutrition program, especially if you have any medical condition, are pregnant, or take medications.</p>

<h2>2) Assumption of Risk</h2>
<p>Physical activity involves inherent risks, including injury or death. You voluntarily assume all risks arising from your use of the app and any activities you undertake. Use proper form and appropriate loads; stop and seek care if you experience pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath.</p>

<h2>3) Accounts & Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least the minimum legal age in your region (generally 16+) and provide accurate information. You are responsible for all activity under your account and for maintaining the security of your credentials.</p>

<h2>4) Subscriptions & Billing</h2>
<p>Some features may require a paid subscription. Subscriptions (if offered) renew automatically unless cancelled in your platform account settings before renewal. Prices may change with notice as required by platform rules. Platform (Apple/Google) terms may also apply.</p>

<h2>5) Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>We and our licensors retain all rights to the app and its content. You receive a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use the app for personal purposes. Do not copy, distribute, or reverse engineer the app.</p>

<h2>6) User Content & Data</h2>
<p>You retain rights to the data you enter (e.g., workouts). You grant us a license to process and store data to provide and improve the service. See the Privacy Policy for details.</p>

<h2>7) Prohibited Use</h2>
<p>Do not use the app unlawfully, to harm others, to attempt to breach security, or in ways that burden or interfere with the service.</p>

<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID (IF ANY) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>

<h2>10) Suspension & Termination</h2>
<p>You may stop using the app at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for misuse or violations of these Terms.</p>

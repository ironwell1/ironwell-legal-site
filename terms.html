<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="muted">Version: 20 Sep 2025 — Applies to users in the United States and Canada</p>

<h2>1) No Medical or Professional Advice</h2>
<p>
Ironwell provides general fitness logging, tracking, and educational content only. 
Ironwell does <em>not</em> provide medical, health, physical therapy, nutritional, or professional fitness coaching advice. 
Nothing in the app constitutes diagnosis, treatment, prevention, or individualized health recommendations.
</p>

<p>
No information in Ironwell should be used for medical decision-making or emergency situations. 
If you have a medical emergency, call your local emergency services immediately.
</p>

<p>
Consult a qualified healthcare professional before beginning or modifying any exercise or nutrition program—especially if you have a known or suspected medical condition, injury, pregnancy, or are taking medications.
Stop exercising immediately if you experience dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, numbness, or unusual discomfort.
</p>

<h2>2) Assumption of Risk</h2>
<p>
Physical exercise carries inherent risks, including injury, muscle strain, illness, or death. 
You understand and agree that you voluntarily assume all risks associated with your fitness activities and any decisions you make using the app’s features.
Ironwell is not responsible for injuries, damages, or losses that result from your activities, improper form, misuse of equipment, or exceeding your physical limits.
</p>

<h2>3) Eligibility & Accounts</h2>
<p>
You must be at least the legal age of digital consent in your region (generally 16+ in the United States and Canada). 
You agree to provide accurate information and are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and all activity on your account.
</p>

<h2>4) Subscriptions & Billing</h2>
<p>
Some features require a paid subscription. Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the renewal date through your Apple App Store or Google Play account settings.
All billing, refunds, taxes, and pricing adjustments follow platform rules (Apple/Google), not Ironwell’s.
Prices may change with notice as required by those platforms.
</p>

<h2>5) Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>
The Ironwell application, brand, graphics, software, and all related intellectual property are owned by Ironwell or its licensors.
You receive a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the app for personal, non-commercial purposes only.
You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or reverse engineer any part of the app.
</p>

<h2>6) User Data & Content</h2>
<p>
You retain rights to the workout information you log, such as sets, reps, weights, and session history.
</p>
<p>
By using the app, you grant Ironwell a license to store, process, display, and use this data solely to operate, maintain, and improve the service.
Ironwell is not responsible for inaccurate or misleading user-entered data.
</p>
<p>
For details on how your data is handled, see our <a href="./privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>

<h2>7) Prohibited Use</h2>
<p>You agree not to use Ironwell to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Violate any laws or regulations.</li>
  <li>Harass, abuse, or harm others.</li>
  <li>Attempt to breach or bypass security systems.</li>
  <li>Copy, scrape, or collect data for commercial purposes.</li>
  <li>Upload malicious code or interfere with app functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8) Disclaimers</h2>
<p>
THE APP, INCLUDING ALL CONTENT AND FEATURES, IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” 
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES—EXPRESS OR IMPLIED—INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
</p>
<p>
We do not guarantee specific fitness results, improvements, or performance outcomes.
Any suggestions, predictions, analytics, or estimated training recommendations are informational only.
</p>

<h2>9) Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IRONWELL, ITS OWNER, AND ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
</p>
<p>
OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE APP SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIM.
</p>

<h2>10) Indemnification</h2>
<p>
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Ironwell, its owner, and its service providers from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, or expenses arising from your misuse of the app or violation of these Terms.
</p>

<h2>11) Suspension & Termination</h2>
<p>
We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms or misuse the service.
You may stop using the app at any time. Deleting your account in the app permanently removes your profile and workout data from active systems.
</p>

<h2>12) Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>
We may update these Terms periodically. When we do, the version date at the top of the page will change.
Continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes acceptance.
</p>

<h2>13) Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>
These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and Canada, depending on your place of residence.
Any disputes must be resolved in the courts located in the U.S. state or Canadian province in which Ironwell primarily operates, unless platform rules require otherwise.
</p>

<h2>14) Operator & Contact Information</h2>

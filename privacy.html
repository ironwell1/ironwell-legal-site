<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">Effective: 20 Sep 2025 (Revised)</p>

<p>Ironwell (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides a fitness logging and workout-tracking application. 
This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices available to you.</p>

<h2>1) What We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect only the information needed to operate and improve the app:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Account Information:</b> When you create an Ironwell account, we collect your email address, first name, and last name to create and manage your account.</li>
  <li><b>Workout Data:</b> Exercises, sets, reps, weights, session history, personal records, and app usage inputs.</li>
  <li><b>Technical Data:</b> IP address, device identifiers, crash logs, timestamp metadata, and other diagnostic information strictly for security and stability of the service.</li>
  <li><b>No Medical Data:</b> We do not collect health diagnoses, medical conditions, biometrics, heart-rate data, or any protected health information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To create and maintain your account.</li>
  <li>To sync and display your workouts across your devices.</li>
  <li>To maintain security, detect abuse, and debug issues.</li>
  <li>To develop and improve the app based on aggregated, anonymized usage patterns.</li>
  <li>To send optional service updates, reminders, or motivational messages (if enabled by you).</li>
</ul>

<h2>3) Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>We do <b>not</b> sell personal data.</p>
<p>We share information only with service providers who help us operate the app (such as hosting, database, analytics, and crash-reporting tools). These providers may store or process information on our behalf under contractual obligations to safeguard your data.</p>
<p>Data may also be disclosed if required by law, regulation, or legal process.</p>

<h2>4) Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
<p>You may delete your account at any time in the app under <i>Profile → Delete Account</i>. This removes your account and associated workout data from active systems.</p>
<p>We may retain minimal information where required to comply with legal obligations (e.g., fraud prevention, audit requirements). Backup systems overwrite data on a scheduled basis.</p>

<h2>5) Your Rights & Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Access / Update:</b> Manage your profile and workout data within the app.</li>
  <li><b>Delete:</b> Use <i>Profile → Delete Account</i> to permanently remove your account.</li>
  <li><b>Notifications:</b> Enable or disable notifications in-app or through your device settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6) Children & Age Requirements</h2>
<p>Ironwell is intended for individuals aged <b>16 or older</b>. We do not knowingly collect or store personal data from anyone under this age. If we become aware that such data has been collected, we will delete it promptly.</p>

<h2>7) Security</h2>
<p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your data. 
However, no method of storage or transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.</p>

<h2>8) International Use</h2>
<p>We operate primarily in the United States and Canada. By using the app, you understand that your information may be stored or processed in these locations or in other regions where our service providers operate.</p>

<h2>9) Fitness-Only Purpose (No Medical Use)</h2>
<p>Ironwell is not a medical device and does not monitor health conditions, provide medical analysis, or offer medical advice. Do not use the app to make medical decisions. Consult a healthcare professional before beginning any exercise program.</p>

<h2>10) Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy. If material changes occur, the effective date above will be updated and the new version will be posted on this page.</p>

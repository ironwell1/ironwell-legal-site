<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">Effective: 22 Sep 2025</p>

<p>Ironwell (“we”, “our”, “us”) is a fitness logging app. This Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your choices. This Policy applies to the App and related support communications.</p>

<h2>1) Data We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Account</b>: email and optional first name.</li>
  <li><b>Workout data</b>: exercises, sets, reps, weights, sessions, and personal records that you log.</li>
  <li><b>Technical</b>: IP address, device/time metadata, and basic diagnostics needed to operate and secure the service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2) How We Use Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide core functionality (account, sync, workout history).</li>
  <li>Secure, maintain, and improve the App (e.g., debugging, preventing misuse).</li>
  <li>Communicate important changes (service updates, legal notices).</li>
</ul>

<h2>3) Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell personal data. We share data only with service providers (e.g., cloud hosting/database, analytics, email) under contract to operate the App on our behalf, or when required by law. These providers may be located in the United States or other countries. We require them to process data only according to our instructions and applicable law.</p>

<h2>4) International Transfers</h2>
<p>We process data primarily in the United States. If you access the App from outside the U.S., your data may be transferred to and processed in the U.S. or other countries that may not provide the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>5) Retention & Deletion</h2>
<p>We retain data for as long as needed to provide the service and for legitimate business needs (e.g., security), unless a longer period is required by law. You can delete your account in-app: <i>Profile → Delete Account</i>. Deleting removes your account and associated workout data from our active systems, subject to any retention required by law (e.g., fraud prevention).</p>

<h2>6) Your Rights</h2>
<p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or port your data, and to object to or restrict certain processing. To exercise a right, contact: privacy@ironwellapp.com. We will verify requests as required by law and respond within applicable timeframes.</p>

<h2>7) Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
<p>Where applicable, we process personal data on these legal bases: (a) contract (to provide the App), (b) legitimate interests (e.g., security, product improvement), and (c) consent where required by law. You may withdraw consent at any time where processing relies on consent.</p>

<h2>8) Children</h2>
<p>The App is not directed to children under the minimum age in their region (generally 16+). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data, contact privacy@ironwellapp.com to request deletion.</p>

<h2>9) Security</h2>
<p>We use reasonable administrative and technical measures to protect data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>10) Security Incidents</h2>
<p>If we learn of a security incident that affects your data, we will notify you as required by law.</p>

<h2>11) Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this Policy. Material changes will be posted here with a new effective date. Your continued use of the App after the effective date means you accept the updated Policy.</p>
